Sales Data Integration & Analysis ProjectThis project focuses on merging disparate retail datasets to create a unified "Master Dataset" for advanced business analytics. It automates the process of joining sales records with product metadata and shipping costs while calculating key financial metrics.📂 Project StructureFileDescriptionsales_data.csvCore transaction data (IDs, Dates, Quantity, Price).product_info.csvProduct metadata (Categories).shipping_details.csvLogistical data (Shipping costs per Order).Merging of datasets.pyPython script to automate data cleaning and merging.master_dataset.csvThe final processed output ready for BI tools.🛠 Data Transformation WorkflowThe integration process follows a standard ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline:Extract: Loads raw CSV data using the pandas library.Transform:Performs a Left Join on Product_ID to attach categories.Performs a Left Join on Order_ID to attach shipping costs.Derives a new feature: Total_Revenue ($Quantity \times Price$).Load: Exports the cleaned data to a new semicolon-delimited CSV file.🚀 How to UsePrerequisitesPython 3.xPandas library (pip install pandas)ExecutionSimply run the python script to generate the master dataset:Bashpython "Merging of datasets.py"
📊 Sample AnalysisWith the resulting master_dataset.csv, you can easily generate insights such as:Revenue by Category: Sum of Total_Revenue grouped by Category.Profit Margins: Calculated by subtracting Shipping_Cost from Total_Revenue.Time Series: Analyzing sales trends across different Order_Date values.📝 LicenseThis project is open-source and available for educational purposes.
